description: Create markdown documentation for the codebase
---
Create a well-structured markdown documentation for the codebase. The documentation should include:
- Overview of the project
- Key components and their purposes
- Architecture and design patterns used
- Developer workflows and conventions
- Examples of usage
- External integrations and dependencies

Make sure to use proper headings, bullet points, and code snippets where appropriate. The documentation should be clear and concise, suitable for developers who are new to the project.

The markdown file should be named `documentation.md` and placed in the root of the codebase. If a `documentation.md` file already exists, update it with the new documentation content while preserving any existing information that is still relevant.
